Project Overview
We'll create a web page that allows users to import data from a CSV file, display it in a table, and export the displayed data back to a CSV file.

Explanation
HTML:

Basic structure with a file input, export button, and table.
Includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
CSS:

Styles for centering the container, styling the table, and ensuring a clean look.
JavaScript:

importCSV: Reads the CSV file and passes its content to displayCSV.
displayCSV: Parses the CSV content and displays it in the table.
exportCSV: Converts the table content back to CSV format and triggers a download.
Running the Project
Create the files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) in your project directory.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Import a CSV file to see the data displayed in the table.
Click the "Export to CSV" button to download the displayed data as a CSV file.
This project covers basic file handling and DOM manipulation using JavaScript, providing a foundation for more complex data management tasks.
